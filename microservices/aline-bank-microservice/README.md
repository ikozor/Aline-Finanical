___
_**NOTE:** This repository is not to be developed on. Create another repository and use this as a template._

### Start developing your microservice here.

### Creating _Your Own_ Repository

___
1. Create a repository under the [Aline Financial](https://github.com/Aline-Financial) organization.
2. Select `Aline-Financial/aline-microservice-template` as the repository template.
3. Clone your repository onto your machine.
4. In the projects root, run `git submodule init`. A `core/` directory should now be created.
5. Run `git submodule update` to pull down the most recent core. (_Note:_ This will clone the [Core Repository](https://github.com/Aline-Financial/core) that is automatically checked out to a hashed branch.)
6. Rename main module to be your microservice.
7. Update CI/CD files to match project.
8. Run `mvn test` to make sure your project builds!

If you get a **success**, you're all set. Start creating your microservice.

### Managing the core

___
The core is a shared-code repository that contains classes such as:
- Models
- Data-Transfer Objects (DTO)
- Repositories
- Custom Exceptions
- Etc...

Before you put code in the core, make sure to consider the following:
> - _"Is there already code in the core that already solves my problem?"_
> - _"Will there be circular dependency between the core and the application module?"_
> - _"Will other microservices need to use this code?"_

**Carefully consider these questions.**

Create a new branch in the core that matches the current feature branch you are working on in the main module.

When pushing up, make sure to run `git status` to make sure core changes do not need to be committed.


**PUSH THE CORE FIRST**

Once the core change are pushed into the repository, **push your whole repository from the parent.** The core branch will update.
